    "# Word Embeddings\n",
    "Image and audio processing systems work with rich, high-dimensional datasets encoded as vectors of numbers. However, natural language processing systems traditionally treat words a discrete atomic symbols, and therefore 'cat' may be represented as Id537 and 'dog' as Id143. These encodings are very sparse and provide no useful information regarding the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols. \n",
